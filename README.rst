===============
Files & Presenttion I used for a Docker workshop during SFD Tunisia 2016 and FreeDev(Freeways ISI)

Usage
=======
Presentation
------------

The presentation is a RST file, you need to use [hovercraft](https://github.com/regebro/hovercraft) to generate the HTML presentation..
Check the 'output' dir for the current generated HTML format.

Workshop
--------

The workshop is supposed to be just an initiation to Docker basic usage.
The workshop directory have a TXT file with some basic commands to try, a Hello World Docker file (To compare with the official hello-world one and build/try), and a docker-compose.yml that need to be debugged and fixed (running it before that will throw errors, but that's a good thing to start with before debugging).
